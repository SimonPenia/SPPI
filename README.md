# SPPI
the Simón Peña Purchase Interface.

This is a (probably) extensive system for calculating purchases to make independant businesses' lives easier.

Basic usage goes as follows:

	cmdlist		// displays available general commands
	prdlist		// displays product list from an array
	money		// displays total money earned for each product
	exit		// closes the application


Unfortunately in this state I can only try it compiling with Mono, and this for some reason crashes on Windows, throwing error code System.IndexOutOfRangeException, however it works fine on Linux.

Feel free to submit any modifications.
