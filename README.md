# SPPI
the Simón Peña Purchase Interface.

This is a (probably) extensive system for calculating purchases to make independent businesses' lives easier.

Basic usage goes as follows:

	help		// Displays available general commands.
	products	// Displays product list from an array.
	buy *product*	// Buys a product, where *product* is typed from the list.
	money		// Displays total money earned for each product.
	exit		// Closes the application.

I have only tried compiling on Linux using Mono, however, the build script also makes a Windows version.

Feel free to submit any modifications.
