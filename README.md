# SPPI
the Simón Peña Purchase Interface.

This is a (probably) extensive system for calculating purchases to make independent businesses' lives easier.

Basic usage goes as follows:

	cmdlist		// displays available general commands
	prdlist		// displays product list from an array
	money		// displays total money earned for each product
	exit		// closes the application


I have only tried compiling on Linux using Mono, however, the build script also makes a Windows version.

Feel free to submit any modifications.
